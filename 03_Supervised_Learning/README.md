# Supervised Learning - Customer Churn Prediction

## 📋 Project Overview

Machine learning classification project to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company, enabling proactive retention strategies and reducing customer attrition.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Build a predictive model to identify customers likely to leave the service, allowing the company to:
- Target at-risk customers with retention offers
- Understand key factors driving churn
- Optimize marketing spend on retention campaigns
- Reduce customer acquisition costs by improving retention

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python**: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Machine Learning**: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC
- **Data Processing**: Feature engineering, handling imbalanced data, scaling

---

## 📊 Dataset

Customer data including:
- Demographics (age, gender, senior citizen status)
- Account information (tenure, contract type, payment method)
- Services subscribed (phone, internet, streaming, tech support)
- Charges (monthly, total)
- Churn status (target variable)

**Dataset Size:** Several thousand customer records

---

## 🔍 Key Findings

1. **Model Performance**: Achieved 85%+ accuracy in predicting customer churn
2. **Key Churn Drivers**: 
   - Month-to-month contracts have highest churn rate
   - Customers with shorter tenure more likely to leave
   - Absence of tech support correlates with higher churn
3. **Risk Segmentation**: Identified high-risk customer profiles
4. **ROI**: Early identification enables targeted retention, reducing churn by up to 20%

## 📈 Methodology

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Analyzed churn patterns across customer segments
   - Identified correlations between features and churn
   - Visualized distribution of key variables

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing values
   - Encoded categorical variables
   - Scaled numerical features
   - Addressed class imbalance

3. **Model Development**
   - Trained multiple classification algorithms
   - Performed hyperparameter tuning
   - Used cross-validation for robust evaluation
   - Selected best model based on F1-score and ROC-AUC

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Confusion matrix analysis
   - Precision-Recall trade-off
   - Feature importance interpretation
   - Business impact assessment

## 💡 Business Impact

- **Proactive Retention**: Early identification of at-risk customers
- **Cost Savings**: Retention is 5-25x cheaper than acquisition
- **Targeted Campaigns**: Data-driven customer segmentation for marketing
- **Strategic Insights**: Understanding churn drivers informs product development

**Estimated Annual Savings:** Preventing 20% of churn could save millions in acquisition costs
