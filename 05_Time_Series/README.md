# Time Series Analysis

## 📋 Project Overview

Time series forecasting project analyzing temporal patterns and building predictive models for sequential data.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Develop time series analysis skills to:
- Identify trends, seasonality, and cyclical patterns
- Build forecasting models for future predictions
- Handle temporal dependencies in data
- Apply time series decomposition techniques

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, statsmodels
- **Time Series Methods**: ARIMA, Moving Average, Exponential Smoothing
- **Analysis**: Trend decomposition, seasonality detection, autocorrelation
- **Visualization**: Time plots, seasonal plots, ACF/PACF diagrams

---

## 📊 Key Concepts Applied

1. **Trend Analysis**: Identified long-term patterns in data
2. **Seasonality Detection**: Uncovered recurring patterns
3. **Stationarity Testing**: Applied statistical tests (ADF test)
4. **Forecasting**: Built predictive models for future values
5. **Model Validation**: Used time-based cross-validation

## 📈 Methodology

1. **Exploratory Analysis**
   - Visualized time series patterns
   - Decomposed into trend, seasonal, residual components
   - Checked for stationarity

2. **Data Preparation**
   - Handled missing timestamps
   - Resampled data at appropriate frequency
   - Applied transformations if needed

3. **Model Building**
   - Selected appropriate forecasting method
   - Tuned model parameters
   - Validated predictions

4. **Forecast Evaluation**
   - Assessed prediction accuracy
   - Analyzed forecast errors
   - Evaluated model reliability
