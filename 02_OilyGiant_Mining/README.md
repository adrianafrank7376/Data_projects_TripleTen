# OilyGiant Mining - Oil Well Location Optimization

## 📋 Project Overview

Predictive analysis project to identify the best locations for 200 new oil wells, maximizing profit while minimizing risk for the OilyGiant mining company.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Analyze geological exploration data from three regions to:
- Build a predictive model for oil reserves
- Calculate potential profit for each region
- Select the region with highest profit margin and lowest risk
- Optimize capital investment decisions

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python**: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, scipy
- **Machine Learning**: Linear Regression
- **Statistical Analysis**: Bootstrapping (1000 samples)
- **Risk Analysis**: Confidence intervals, probability calculations
- **Metrics**: RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

---

## 📊 Dataset

Geological exploration data from three regions including:
- Oil quality measurements
- Volume of reserves
- Geographic coordinates (latitude/longitude)
- Historical production data

**Dataset Size:** 100,000 measurements across 3 regions

---

## 🔍 Key Findings

1. **Best Region Identified**: Region with optimal balance of high reserves and low risk
2. **Profit Prediction**: Average predicted profit per 200 wells calculated
3. **Risk Assessment**: 2.5% risk threshold maintained through statistical validation
4. **ROI Analysis**: Break-even point determined for investment decisions

**Business Impact:**
- Identified most profitable region for $100M investment
- Minimized financial risk through data-driven selection
- Optimized resource allocation for maximum ROI

## 📈 Methodology

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Analyzed reserve distributions across regions
   - Identified outliers and data quality issues
   - Compared regional characteristics

2. **Predictive Modeling**
   - Built Linear Regression model for each region
   - Predicted oil reserves for potential wells
   - Validated model accuracy using RMSE

3. **Profit Calculation**
   - Selected top 200 wells per region
   - Calculated revenue based on reserves and oil price
   - Subtracted investment costs for net profit

4. **Risk Analysis (Bootstrapping)**
   - Generated 1000 bootstrap samples per region
   - Calculated profit distribution
   - Determined 95% confidence intervals
   - Assessed probability of losses
