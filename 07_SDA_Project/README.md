# Statistical Data Analysis (SDA)

## 📋 Project Overview

Comprehensive statistical analysis project applying hypothesis testing and statistical inference to make data-driven business decisions.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Apply statistical methods to:
- Test business hypotheses using rigorous statistical methods
- Determine statistical significance of findings
- Make data-backed recommendations
- Understand probability distributions and their applications

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python**: pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Statistical Tests**: t-tests, z-tests, chi-square tests, ANOVA
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Null/alternative hypotheses, p-values, confidence intervals
- **Probability**: Normal distribution, binomial distribution, statistical inference

---

## 📊 Key Concepts Applied

1. **Hypothesis Testing**: Formulated and tested statistical hypotheses
2. **A/B Testing**: Compared groups to determine significant differences
3. **Confidence Intervals**: Calculated ranges for population parameters
4. **Statistical Significance**: Determined p-values and significance levels
5. **Effect Size**: Measured practical significance of findings

---

## 📈 Methodology

1. **Problem Formulation**
   - Defined null and alternative hypotheses
   - Set significance level (α = 0.05)
   - Identified appropriate statistical test

2. **Data Preparation**
   - Checked assumptions (normality, independence, equal variance)
   - Handled outliers appropriately
   - Prepared data for statistical testing

3. **Statistical Testing**
   - Performed appropriate tests
   - Calculated test statistics and p-values
   - Interpreted results in business context

4. **Conclusion & Recommendations**
   - Determined whether to reject null hypothesis
   - Assessed practical significance
   - Provided actionable insights
